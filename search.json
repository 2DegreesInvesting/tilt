    "text": "This is an overview of tilt’s software and data.\nMost links are public but some are restricted to the members of the domain 2degrees-investing.org, the members of the GitHub organization 2DegreesInvesting, or specific people.\n\n\n\n\nThis website mentions a number of GitHub repositores (repos) under our GitHub organization. I avoid direct links so that this website remains accurate if the repos move to a different organization. Search our repos at https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/repositories.\nOur GitHub organization has many repos. The most relevant ones use the prefix “tilt” (e.g. tiltIndicator) and the topic “tiltsmes”.\n\nSearch public repositories.\nSearch private repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\nTowards the top, each repo has an “About” seciton with useful information and/or links:\n\nUnder the folders and files, each repo has at least a short description of its goal, and commonly and “Installation” and “Example” section:\n\nMost repos also have a website (linked in “About”) with a function’s “Reference” and a “Changelog”:\n\n\n\n\nThe most relevant repositories are structured as an R package. “Every package must have a DESCRIPTION. In fact, it’s the defining feature of a package”. If a package depends on another package, then that package dependency is listed under the fields Depends, Imports, Suggests, or Remotes.\nRemotes lists packages that are not on CRAN, such as all of the packages in the tilt ecosystem. For example, this is the Remotes section of the DESCRIPTION file of tiltIndicatorAfter:\nRemotes: \n    2DegreesInvesting/tiltIndicator,\n    2degreesinvesting/tiltToyData,\n    2DegreesInvesting/tiltAddCO2,\n    2degreesinvesting/tiltTransitionRisk,\n    2degreesinvesting/tiltPolish\nThis means that the package tiltIndicatorAfter depends on five other packages: tiltIndicator, tiltToyData, tiltAddCO2, tiltTransitionRisk, and tiltPolish. And they are all hosted on the GitHub organization 2DegreesInvesting.\nLearn more in the book R Packages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tilt app is our most public-facing technical product. It helps users learn about the tilt project, and explore and request data. It’s built with R shiny, it’s structured as an R package, and is hosted on Google Cloud Run.\nThe tilt app depends directly on two repos:\n\ntiltWebTool: Public software.\ntiltWebToolData: Private data used in the app.\n\nFor information about the tilt app project including links to the app see https://bit.ly/tilt-app-info. For an overview about building and hosting the app see https://bit.ly/tilt-offboarding-videos.\n\n\n\nThe app’s data is generated via multiple other repositories. Here is how the most important ones relate to each other, starting from the one closest to the app, and moving towards the deeper layers of the system’s architecture:\n\ntiltOutput: Archive of the private data, with multiple versions and intermediate outputs.\ntiltIndicatorAfter: Process indicator results so that they are closer to the user-facing outputs. This is an R package and depends on multiple other “tilt” packages. See the Remotes section` of its DESCRIPTION file to discover every dependency.\ntiltIndicator: Implement the core business logic of the tilt indicators.\ntiltToyData: Toy datasets.\ntiltIndicatorBefore: Create input datasets for the tilt ecosystem.\ntiltData: Process company and other data.\ntiltEp: Get company data from the web.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://bit.ly/tilt-app-videos\nhttps://bit.ly/tilt-wrap-up\nR Packages\nMastering Shiny\nGoogle Cloud\n\n\n\n\nThis is a Quarto website. To update it you would tipically need to clone the code, change a file, preview the results, render the site, and push your changes to GitHub (video)."
