This is an overview of tilt's software and data.

Most links are public but some are restricted to the members of the
domain 2degrees-investing.org, the members of the GitHub organization
2DegreesInvesting, or specific people.

## Navigating the code

### How to find the most relevant repos

This website mentions a number of GitHub repositores (repos) under our
GitHub organization. I avoid direct links so that this website remains
accurate if the repos move to a different organization. Search our repos
at <https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/repositories>.

Our GitHub organization has many repos. The most relevant ones use the
prefix "tilt" (e.g. tiltIndicator) and the topic "tiltsmes".

* [Search public repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A2DegreesInvesting+topic%3Atiltsmes+is%3Apublic+&type=repositories).
* [Search private repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A2DegreesInvesting+topic%3Atiltsmes+is%3Aprivate&type=repositories).

## How to understand what each repo is about

Towards the top, each repo has an "About" seciton with useful information and/or links:

Under the folders and files, each repo has at least a short description of its goal, and commonly 
and "Installation" and "Example" section:

Most repos also have a website (linked in "About") with a function's "Reference" and a "Changelog":

### How to find how one repo or R package relates to another

The most relevant repositories are structured as an R package. "[Every
package must have a DESCRIPTION. In fact, it's the defining feature of a
package](https://r-pkgs.org/description.html#the-description-file)". If
a package depends on another package, then that package dependency is
listed under the fields `Depends`, `Imports`, `Suggests`, or `Remotes`.

`Remotes` lists packages that are not on CRAN, such as all of the
packages in the tilt ecosystem. For example, this is the `Remotes`
section of the DESCRIPTION file of tiltIndicatorAfter:

```
Remotes: 
    2DegreesInvesting/tiltIndicator,
    2degreesinvesting/tiltToyData,
    2DegreesInvesting/tiltAddCO2,
    2degreesinvesting/tiltTransitionRisk,
    2degreesinvesting/tiltPolish
```

This means that the package tiltIndicatorAfter depends on five other
packages: tiltIndicator, tiltToyData, tiltAddCO2, tiltTransitionRisk,
and tiltPolish. And they are all hosted on the GitHub organization
2DegreesInvesting.

## Highlights

### The app

The tilt app is our most public-facing technical product. It helps users
learn about the tilt project, and explore and request data. It's built
with R shiny, it's structured as an R package, and is hosted on Google
Cloud Run.

The tilt app depends directly on two repos:

* tiltWebTool: Public software.
* tiltWebToolData: Private data used in the app.

For information about the tilt app project including links to the app
see <https://bit.ly/tilt-app-info>. For an overview about building and
hosting the app see <https://bit.ly/tilt-offboarding-videos>.

### Other related repos:

The app's data is generated via multiple other repositories. Here is how the
most important ones relate to each other, starting from the one closest to
the app, and moving towards the deeper layers of the system's architecture:

* tiltOutput: Archive of the private data, with multiple versions and
intermediate outputs.
* tiltIndicatorAfter: Process indicator results so that they are closer
to the user-facing outputs. This is an R package and depends on multiple
other "tilt" packages. See the `Remotes` section` of its DESCRIPTION
file to discover every dependency.
* tiltIndicator: Implement the core business logic of the tilt indicators.
* tiltToyData: Toy datasets.
* tiltIndicatorBefore: Create input datasets for the tilt ecosystem.
* tiltData: Process company and other data.
* tiltEp: Get company data from the web.
