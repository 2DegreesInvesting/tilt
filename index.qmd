This website overviews the technical aspects of the tilt ecosystem.

Most links are public but some are restricted to the members of the
domain 2degrees-investing.org, the members of the GitHub organization
2DegreesInvesting, or specific people.

## How to find the most relevant repos

This website mentions a number of GitHub repositores (repos) under our
GitHub organization. I avoid direct links so that this website remains
accurate if the repos move to a different organization. Search our repos
at <https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/repositories>.

Our GitHub organization has many repos. The most relevant ones use the
prefix "tilt" (e.g. tiltIndicator) and the topic "tiltsmes".

* [Search public repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A2DegreesInvesting+topic%3Atiltsmes+is%3Apublic+&type=repositories).
* [Search private repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A2DegreesInvesting+topic%3Atiltsmes+is%3Aprivate&type=repositories).

## How to understand what each repo is about

Towards the top, each repo has an "About" seciton with useful information and/or links:

Under the folders and files, each repo has at least a short description of its goal, and commonly 
and "Installation" and "Example" section:

Most repos also have a website (linked in "About") with a function's "Reference" and a "Changelog":

intermediate outputs.
