This website gives overviews the technical aspects of the tilt ecosystem.

Most links are public but some are restricted to the members of the
domain 2degrees-investing.org, the members of the GitHub organization
2DegreesInvesting, or specific people.

## How to find the most relevant repos

This website mentions a number of GitHub repositores (repos) under our
GitHub organization. I avoid direct links so that this website remains
accurate if the repos move to a different organization. Search our repos
at <https://github.com/orgs/2DegreesInvesting/repositories>.

Our GitHub organization has many repos. The most relevant ones use the
prefix "tilt" (e.g. tiltIndicator) and the topic "tiltsmes".

* [Search public repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A2DegreesInvesting+topic%3Atiltsmes+is%3Apublic+&type=repositories).
* [Search private repositories](https://github.com/search?q=org%3A2DegreesInvesting+topic%3Atiltsmes+is%3Aprivate&type=repositories).

## How to understand what each repo is about

The best place to unserstand what each repo is about is it's home page on GitHub.

* At the top you'll find an "About" seciton with useful information and/or links:

* Scroll past folders and files to read about the goal of the repo and any
relevant information, typically about the "Installation" and at least one
"Example".
